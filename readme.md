Refactoring Golf is a game designed to explore your IDE to see what's really possible using shortcuts and automation.

For this exercise, you should pair up, and the person with the most experience with Rider refactoring should 'navigate' while the least experienced 'drives'

While most refactorings can be done by mouse from the 'refactor' menu, real 'golfers' use the keyboard:

It's also a lot easier to communicate a key combination than menu selections in most cases...

You will find two versions of every project:
- ROUND_N_A
- ROUND_N_B

The _A project is the before (in gold terms, the "tee"), and the _B project is the after (the "hole").

Your goal is to safely and efficiently as possible refactor the _A code to look like the _B code. You must aim to do it in as few "strokes" as possible, incurring as few points as possible.

A "stroke" is a change made to the code, and every stroke costs you points.

Your pairing partner should carefully score you as follows:

## Add points
- +1 points for every refactor
- +1 points for every Copy+paste
- +1 points for every change made to the code using a shortcut or automated IDE feature (e.g., an automated refactoring, code template, or Find/Replace)

## Plus points
- +2 points for every line of code manually edited
- X2 points For every change made while the code cannot pass the tests after the previous change

## Empty points
- +0 points revert changes (ctrl + z git revert)
- +0 points formatting
- +0 points remove code
- +0 points remove lines
- +0 points change access methods or classes
